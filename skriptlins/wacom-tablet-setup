# DESCRIPTION
# 	Sets up a simple Wacom tablet like the Intuos.
#
# PLEASE READ
# 	As of right now, you have to have the table connected to the computer
# 	as the system is booting from a complete power off (no reboot) to get 
# 	the pen to work. Working on this.
#
# NOTES
# 	- Must be ran as root.
# 	- Does not check if this script has been ran previously.
#
# TROUBLESHOOT WALKTHROUGH
# 	I just plugged in my Wacom tablet. I wonder if my system registers that
# 	I plugged the tablet in? 
#
# 	1. Check dmesg for something like "Wacom".
# 	$ dmesg
#
# 	Idk. It's an external device right? What information can I get about it?
# 	2. List all usb devices and search for one called.
# 	"Wacom".
# 	# usbconfig
#
# 	Ok. I found that it is "ugen1.2". So what more information can I find 
# 	out about it?
#
# 	3. Get a all information the system knows about that device.
# 	# usbconfig -d ugen1.2 dump_all_desc
#
# 	Ok that output looks Greek to me. Oh yeah! I just plugged an exteral 
# 	thing into my computer. It probably needs a driver!
#
# 4. Search web for wacom driver name and install it.
pkg install xf86-input-wacom wacomd

# 5.0 Required by webcamd as per their man page. I don't know why this is not 
#     mentioned when installing webcamd...
echo "cuse_enable=\"YES\"" >> /boot/loader.conf

# 5. Make sure the system knows to enable this service upon startup.
sysrc webcamd_enable="YES"

# 6. Stuff the driver maintainer/commenter asks us to do.
pw groupmod webcamd -m $(whoami)
service devd restart

# 7. Unfortunately `service webcamd (one)start` doesn't work here, but powering
#    off with the tablet plugged and back on with the tablet still plugged
#    in should work.
poweroff
